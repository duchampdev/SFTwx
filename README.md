# SFTwx
SFTwx is a native application for copying files in alphabetical order.
Many other tools do not copy the files in aphabetical order but in the physical order on the disk. The copying order becomes relevant when using (embededded) systems which always sort by date like some car hifi systems do.


This a rewrite of [SortedFileTransfer](https://github.com/duchampdev/FinanceOrganizationTool) in C++ using wxWidgets.
